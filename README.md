# Prize-Collecting-TSP-with-Budget

This repository contains code for the algorithm described in the paper [Budgeted Prize-Collecting Traveling Salesman and Minimum Spanning Tree Problems.](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/moor.2019.1002)

Note: binary search is used to set $\lambda_1$ rather than the formal procedure found in the paper.
